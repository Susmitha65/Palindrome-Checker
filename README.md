 Palindrome-Checker

 A simple and efficient Python program designed to determine whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Features
User Input Handling: Accepts input from the user and processes it for palindrome checking.
Case Insensitive: Ignores case differences (e.g., "RaceCar" is considered a palindrome).
Ignores Non-Alphanumeric Characters: Filters out spaces, punctuation, and other non-alphanumeric characters to focus on the core letters and numbers.
Easy to Use: Simple interface with clear results indicating whether the input is a palindrome or not.
